## Your Second Chance to Complete the Weave-Shippable Challenge!

For all of those who didn't have time to participate during re:Invent, you have
a second chance!  

In this challenge, you'll set up fully automated deployments
of the front-end component for the microservices-based, containerized
[Socks Shop eCommerce](https://microservices-demo.github.io/) application, in
30 minutes or less.

The sample application will feature:

  * **Amazon ECS**{: style="color: orange"} for container orchestration
  * **Amazon ECR**{: style="color: orange"} for container registry
  * **<a href="https://www.weave.works/weave-scope" style="color: orange">Weave Scope</a>** for troubleshooting and visualizing your app
  * **<a href="https://www.weave.works/weave-net" style="color: orange">Weave Net</a>** for container networking and service discovery
  * **Shippable**{: style="color: orange"} for automated CI/CD

To complete the challenge, you will:

  * Configure a CI/CD pipeline and deploy the <a href="https://github.com/microservices-demo/front-end" style="color: orange">
  front-end</a> service using Shippable
  * Explore the Weave Scope and Shippable services
  * Register for the prize drawing

### Configure an automated CI/CD pipeline

A Weave-enabled Amazon ECS cluster is already running all of the services
of the Socks Shop application, except one. You'll use Shippable to set up an automated CI/CD pipeline to deploy the <a href="https://github.com/microservices-demo/front-end" style="color: orange">
front-end</a> service.

1. <p>Create a <a href="https://app.shippable.com/login.html" style="color: orange">Shippable</a>
account using your GitHub credentials. After logging in with GitHub the first time, perform one of the following:</p>
    * Click the gear icon in upper right and select 'Enable' private projects in the Git Identities section
    * OR navigate to <a href="https://app.shippable.com/auth/github/581532953d9ed90f00b6c0e7/public" style="color: orange">
    this page</a> and follow the prompts to authorize public project access

2. <p>Enable the <span style="color: orange">front-end</span> repo for <span style="color: orange">
CI</span> in Shippable</p>
    * In your local copy of the `front-end` repo, make the image tag you'll push
    unique by updating the `IMAGE_TAG` environment variable in the shippable.yml
    file with your last name:
    * Replace `yourName` with your last name:
      <pre>
      env:
        global:
          - IMAGE_TAG=yourName.$BRANCH.$BUILD_NUMBER
      </pre>

    * Commit and push your changes to Github
      <pre>
      $ git commit -am 'update shippable.yml with my last name'
      $ git push origin master
      </pre>
    * Select your Subscription from the drop-down menu (three horizontal lines)
    in upper left
    * Select `Enable project` in left-hand nav
    * Find the `front-end` repo in the list and select `Enable`
    * Verify that your `front-end` project has been enabled:
    ![front-end-enable](../assets/img/shippable-pipeline-2.png){:width="600px"}

{:start="3"}
3. <p>Store your credentials for integrating with <span style="color: orange">Shippable</span>
 and <span style="color: orange">Amazon ECR</span> and <span style="color: orange">
 Amazon ECS</span></p>
  * Navigate to `Account Settings` via the gear icon in the upper right
  * Select `Integrations` tab
  * Select `Add Integration`
    * Select `Create Integration` next to `Amazon ECR` in the list and complete the fields, as follows:
      * Integration Name: name your integration `shippable-ecr`
      * For this challenge, you'll use a pre-configured user with keys AKIAJN2MBNFZ5QO5K6BQ and TtS/ic0hQYQubWasp3Qht0xbiIoLvjqYH/9YZo0J
      * Copy/paste the Aws_access_key_id and Aws_secret_access_key into the
      Shippable fields
      * Subscriptions: select `All projects` or the GitHub account you forked the
      challenge repos into to allow your subscription(s) to use these credentials
      * Select `Save`
      ![acct-integration-ecr](../assets/img/shippable-pipeline-3b.png){:width="600px"}

      * Repeat these steps for `Amazon ECS` - select `Add Integration`
        * Select `AWS` from the list
        * Name your integration `shippable-aws`
        * Copy/paste the `Aws_access_key_id` and `Aws_secret_access_key` into the
        Shippable fields (use the same values from above)
        * Subscriptions: select `All projects` or the GitHub account you forked the
        challenge repos into to allow your subscription(s) to use these credentials
        * Select `Save`

{:start="4"}
4. <p>Create the <span style="color: orange">front-end CD pipeline</span></p>
In your local copy of the `pipelines` repo, you'll need to update
the `shippable.resources.yml` configuration file with a unique port mapping for
the service you'll deploy:
    * Resource `img-opts-front-end-test`

      <pre>
      # Docker image options for TEST environment
        - name: img-opts-front-end-test
          type: dockerOptions
          version:
            portMappings:
              - 40000:40000
      </pre>
      * Replace the portMappings with a port number you select between 40001-49999,
      e.g. `40833:40833`. Note that your deployment will fail if you select a port
      number that is already taken.
      <p></p>

    * Resource `params-front-end-test`

      <pre>
      # Environment variables for TEST environment
        - name: params-front-end-test
          type: params
          version:
            params:
              ENVIRONMENT: "development"
              NODE_ENV: "development"
              PORT: 40000
      </pre>
      * Replace the value for `PORT` to match the value you supplied in `portMappings` above, e.g. `40833`
      <p></p>
    * Resource `img-opts-front-end-prod`

      <pre>
      # Docker image options for PROD environment
        - name: img-opts-front-end-prod
          type: dockerOptions
          version:
            portMappings:
              - 50000:50000
      </pre>
      * Replace the portMappings with a port number between 50000-59999,  e.g.
      `50833:50833`. Note that your deployment will fail if you select a port
      number that is already taken.
      <p></p>

    * Resource `params-front-end-prod`

      <pre>
      # Environment variables for PROD environment
        - name: params-front-end-prod
          type: params
          version:
            params:
              ENVIRONMENT: "production"
              NODE_ENV: "production"
              PORT: 50000
      </pre>
      * Replace the value for `PORT` to match the value you supplied in
      `portMappings` above, e.g. `50833`
      <p></p>

      Now, update the `shippable.jobs.yml` configuration file with your
      unique port mapping for the service you'll deploy:

      * Resource `yourName-ecs-deploy-test-front-end`

        <pre>
        # TEST deployment to Amazon ECS
          - name: yourName-ecs-deploy-test-front-end
            type: deploy
            steps:
              - IN: man-front-end
              - IN: params-front-end-test
              - IN: trigger-front-end-test
              - IN: cluster-demo-ecs
              - IN: alb-front-end-test
                applyTo:
                  - manifest: man-front-end
                    image: img-front-end
                    port: 40000
              - TASK: managed
        </pre>
        * Replace `yourName` in the `name` value with your last name, e.g.
        `name: smith-ecs-deploy-test-front-end`
        * Replace the `port` value with your Test port number from above, e.g.
        `40833`
        <p></p>
      * Resource `yourName-ecs-deploy-prod-front-end`

        <pre>
        # PROD deployment to Amazon ECS
          - name: yourName-ecs-deploy-prod-front-end
            type: deploy
            steps:
              - IN: yourName-ecs-deploy-test-front-end
                switch: off
              # - IN: release-front-end
              #   switch: off
              - IN: img-opts-front-end-prod
              - IN: params-front-end-prod
              - IN: replicas-front-end-prod
              - IN: trigger-front-end-prod
              - IN: alb-front-end-prod
                applyTo:
                  - manifest: man-front-end
                    image: img-front-end
                    port: 50000
              - IN: cluster-demo-ecs
              - TASK: managed        </pre>
        * Replace `yourName` in the `name` value with your last name, e.g.
        `name: smith-ecs-deploy-test-front-end`
        * Replace `yourName` in the first `IN` value with your last name, e.g.
        `IN: smith-ecs-deploy-test-front-end`
        * Replace the `port` value with your Prod port number from above, e.g.
        `50833`
        <p></p>

      Commit and push your changes to `shippable.jobs.yml` and `shippable.resources.yml`
      to your fork of the `pipelines` repo on Github
      <pre>
